### Hi there 👋


# Hello, I'm Joseph Adeola! 👋
![Robotics](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/…/robotics-banner.png) 

I'm a graduate student specializing in Intelligent Robotics with a focus on motion planning, machine learning, and computer vision. I’m passionate about research in robotic applications using LLMs and currently delving into Task Planning for Robotic Applications at the Austrian Institute of Technology GmbH. When I’m not programming robots or designing algorithms, you can find me immersed in a math challenge, contributing to innovative research projects, or possibly mentoring the next generation of tech enthusiasts!
